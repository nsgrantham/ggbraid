#' Average Daily Temperatures
#'
#' A dataset containing daily average temperatures of New York and San Francisco
#' in 2021 as recorded by the US National Weather Service (NWS) at weather.gov.
#'
#' It is difficult to pull data from the NWS. It does not provide the data via
#' an API and the data it returns through its point-and-click interface isn't in
#' plain text format! To make matters worse, you can only retrieve data from a
#' city one month at a time.
#'
#' For San Francisco, visit \url{https://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate?wfo=mtr}
#' and choose "San Francisco City, CA", "Daily data for a month", and a month
#' from 2021; for New York, visit \url{https://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate?wfo=okx}
#' and choose "NY-Central Park Area", "Daily data for a month", and a month from
#' 2021. Copy and paste the data into spreadsheet software for further processing.
#'
#' @format A data frame (specifically a tbl_df) with 730 rows and 3 variables:

#'   \item{\code{avg}}{Average temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (Â°F) rounded to
#'   the nearest half degree}
