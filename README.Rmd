ggbraid provides a new stat, `stat_braid()`, that extends the functionality of `geom_ribbon()` to correctly fill the area between two alternating lines (or steps) with two different colors. ggbraid also provides a geom, `geom_braid()`, that wraps `geom_ribbon()` and uses `stat_braid()` by default.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggbraid from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nsgrantham/ggbraid")
```

## Usage

To demonstrate, let's generate a long dataset with two alternating series.

```{r example}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggbraid)
library(tidyr)

set.seed(42)  # for reproducibility

n <- 21

df_long <- tibble(
  x = c(1:n, 1:n),
  y = c(rnorm(n), rnorm(n, mean = 0.5)),
  z = c(rep("a", n), rep("b", n))
)

df_long
```

And let's pivot the dataset wider so we can use it with `geom_ribbon()` and `geom_braid()`.

```{r pivot-wider}
df_wide <- pivot_wider(df_long, names_from = z, values_from = y)

df_wide
```

Now let's draw the two series as lines and fill the area between them with a single color using `geom_ribbon()`.

```{r geom-ribbon-without-fill}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x, y, linetype = z), data = df_long) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x, ymin = a, ymax = b), data = df_wide, alpha = 0.2) +
  guides(linetype = "none")
```

Looking good.

Now what about two different colors? One color for when the solid line is _above_ the dashed line, and a different color when the solid line is _below_ the dashed line.

That shouldn't be too hard. Let's use `geom_ribbon()` again and map `a < b` to the `fill` aesthetic.

```{r geom-ribbon-with-fill}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x, y, linetype = z), data = df_long) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x, ymin = a, ymax = b, fill = a < b), data = df_wide, alpha = 0.6) +
  guides(linetype = "none", fill = "none")
```

Chaos. What happened?

This is called the "Unbraided Ribbon Problem".

Not to worry, we can braid the unbraided ribbon with ggbraid â€” simply replace `geom_ribbon()` with `geom_braid()`.

```{r geom-braid-with-fill}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x, y, linetype = z), data = df_long) +
  geom_braid(aes(x, ymin = a, ymax = b, fill = a < b), data = df_wide, alpha = 0.6) +
  guides(linetype = "none", fill = "none")
```

There we go.
