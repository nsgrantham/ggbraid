}
}
\usage{
temps
}
\description{
A dataset containing daily average temperatures of New York and San Francisco
in 2021 as recorded by the US National Weather Service (NWS) at weather.gov.
}
\details{
It is difficult to pull data from the NWS. It does not provide the data via
an API and the data it returns through its point-and-click interface isn't in
plain text format! To make matters worse, you can only retrieve data from a
city one month at a time.

For San Francisco, visit \url{https://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate?wfo=mtr}
and choose "San Francisco City, CA", "Daily data for a month", and a month
from 2021; for New York, visit \url{https://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate?wfo=okx}
and choose "NY-Central Park Area", "Daily data for a month", and a month from
2021. Copy and paste the data into spreadsheet software for further processing.
