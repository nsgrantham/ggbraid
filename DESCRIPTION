Title: Fill the area between two alternating lines with `geom_braid()`
Version: 0.1.0

Description: It is difficult to properly fill the area between
    two lines in `ggplot2`. Use of `geom_ribbon()` is encouraged,
    but it does not always work as expected due to a potentional 
    mismatch between the data and how `geom_ribbon()` requires
    the data to be arranged. This package introduces `geom_braid()`,
    a substitute for `geom_ribbon()` that takes care of these details
    before applying `geom_ribbon()`, resulting in a correctly filled
    area between two alternating lines.
